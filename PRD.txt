- Export functionality for high-resolution images

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Local development environment with Python 3.9+
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- Version control using Git for code and data
- Data storage in JSON format for easy portability

# Development Roadmap  
## Phase 1: Data Acquisition MVP
- Establish comprehensive data model for CapEx information
- Create initial JSON schema for storing structured data
- Implement data collection for primary sources (10-K reports, earnings calls)
- Develop basic data validation to ensure consistency
- Produce initial dataset with available information for all seven companies

## Phase 2: Data Enrichment
- Expand data collection to secondary sources
- Implement advanced validation with cross-referencing
- Fill gaps in historical data through additional research
- Create detailed notes on methodology per company
- Normalize all data points to ensure comparability

## Phase 3: Analysis & Visualization
- Develop time series analysis of CapEx trends
- Create comparative analysis across companies
- Implement correlation analysis with business outcomes
- Build visualization suite for different analytical perspectives
- Generate insights on industry patterns and future projections

## Phase 4: Advanced Analysis
- Incorporate AI investment specificity where available
- Create forecasting models for future CapEx trends
- Develop competitive positioning analysis
- Implement geographical distribution analysis
- Produce comprehensive analytical report with findings

# Research Challenges & Mitigations  
## Data Consistency Challenges
- **Challenge**: Companies report CapEx differently, with varying levels of granularity
- **Mitigation**: Develop standardized estimation methodology for companies that don't explicitly report data center CapEx

## Data Availability Limitations
- **Challenge**: Private companies or segments may have limited financial disclosure
- **Mitigation**: Use triangulation from industry reports, supplier data, and expert estimates

## Temporal Alignment Issues
- **Challenge**: Different fiscal year reporting periods
- **Mitigation**: Normalize all data to calendar years with appropriate allocation methods

## AI-Specific Allocation
- **Challenge**: Difficulty separating AI-specific infrastructure from general cloud CapEx
- **Mitigation**: Use company guidance and analyst research to estimate proportions where explicit breakdowns unavailable

## Resource Constraints
- **Challenge**: Limited access to premium financial databases
- **Mitigation**: Leverage publicly available information with robust validation techniques
