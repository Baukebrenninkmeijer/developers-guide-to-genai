# The Developers Guide to AI

## Abstract
The JavaScript ecosystem is notorious for its framework proliferationâ€”a phenomenon now mirrored in generative AI. Each week brings new LLMs, frameworks, IDEs, and GPU startups. While ChatGPT, Copilot, and DeepSeek have gained recognition, powerful tools like Claude, Cline, Cursor, and Windsurf remain less familiar to many professionals.

This talk provides a comprehensive overview of generative AI, exploring how these technologies function and the diverse capabilities they offer. We'll examine how to effectively incorporate these tools into both product development and software engineering workflows. Beginning with core fundamentals, we'll progress through structured responses, visual models, and reasoning capabilities, before exploring specialized development environments and IDE integrations that can transform your productivity.
