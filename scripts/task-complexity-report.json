      "taskTitle": "Establish Data Model and JSON Schema",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of creating a standardized JSON schema for CapEx data across seven companies, including data model design, schema validation, metadata fields, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires deep domain knowledge of financial data structures and JSON Schema design. It's foundational for the entire project and requires careful consideration of multiple data fields, varying company reporting styles, and metadata requirements. The complexity comes from ensuring the schema is flexible enough to accommodate different reporting structures while maintaining standardization."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Primary Data Collection System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for building a comprehensive web scraping and API integration framework for financial data collection from SEC filings and other sources for the Magnificent Seven tech companies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex web scraping across multiple sources with different structures (SEC EDGAR, earnings calls, investor presentations). Each company may format their data differently, requiring custom parsers. Additional complexity comes from handling rate limits, error conditions, and extracting structured data from unstructured text. The system must be robust and handle various edge cases."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Data Cleaning and Normalization Pipeline",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the specific components needed for a data processing pipeline that cleans, validates, and normalizes CapEx data, including currency conversion, fiscal-to-calendar year normalization, and handling of missing values.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires sophisticated data transformation logic to handle multiple data inconsistencies. Currency conversion, fiscal/calendar alignment, and estimation methodologies for missing data all add complexity. The pipeline must maintain data integrity while applying multiple transformations, and all steps must be transparent and well-documented."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Source Attribution and Validation System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Define the components needed for a cross-referencing validation system that tracks data provenance, implements confidence scoring, and creates an audit trail for financial data validation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires building a system that maintains meticulous tracking of data sources and implements confidence scoring algorithms. The complexity comes from designing a system that can compare data across multiple sources, detect inconsistencies, and provide clear validation paths. It's moderately complex but more straightforward than the data collection and cleaning tasks."

      "taskTitle": "Develop Time Series Analysis Functions",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the development of statistical analysis components for CapEx data, including growth rate calculations, trend identification, seasonal decomposition, and correlation analysis.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing various statistical methods for time series analysis. While the individual methods (CAGR, trend analysis, correlation) are well-established, the complexity comes from ensuring they work together cohesively, handle edge cases appropriately, and produce accurate results with potentially incomplete data. Creating reusable components adds design complexity."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Build Basic Visualization System",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to create a core visualization pipeline for CapEx data using matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, including time series plots, comparative charts, and standardized styling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing standard visualization types with consistent styling. While it requires good design sense and knowledge of visualization libraries, the technical complexity is moderate since it primarily involves configuring existing visualization tools rather than creating novel algorithms. The main challenges are ensuring visual consistency and creating reusable components."

    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Data Enrichment",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Outline the process for expanding CapEx data collection to secondary sources and implementing methodologies for estimating AI-specific infrastructure investments across the Magnificent Seven tech companies.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines complex data collection from diverse secondary sources with sophisticated estimation methodologies. Determining AI-specific allocations where not explicitly reported requires domain expertise and potentially complex inference models. The variety of sources and the subjective nature of some estimations add significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Advanced Visualization and Interactive Dashboard",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of creating interactive visualization components and a comprehensive dashboard for CapEx data exploration using plotly and Dash.",
      "reasoning": "Building interactive visualizations and an integrated dashboard requires both technical implementation skills and user experience design. The complexity comes from creating cohesive interactions between multiple visualization components, implementing filtering capabilities, and ensuring performance with potentially large datasets. The dashboard must present complex data relationships clearly."

    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Forecasting Models",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for developing statistical or machine learning models to forecast future CapEx trends, including model selection, implementation, validation, and scenario analysis capabilities.",
      "reasoning": "Forecasting financial metrics involves sophisticated statistical or machine learning techniques. The complexity stems from selecting appropriate models, handling limited historical data, quantifying uncertainty, and creating mechanisms for scenario analysis. The models must be both accurate and interpretable, with clear documentation of assumptions."

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Generate Comprehensive Documentation and Final Report",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of creating detailed technical documentation and a final analytical report for the CapEx analysis project, including methodology explanations, limitations, and key findings.",
      "reasoning": "While this task requires synthesizing information from across the entire project, the complexity is moderate compared to the technical implementation tasks. The challenge lies in clearly communicating complex methodologies and findings to different audiences, ensuring completeness, and producing high-quality visualizations for the final report."
